Linux distributions cater to various audiences and needs, with large organizations often choosing commercially-supported options like Red Hat, SUSE, and Ubuntu. Free alternatives like CentOS and CentOS Stream (replaced by CentOS Stream in 2021) are popular among those comfortable without paid support, while Alma Linux and Rocky Linux have emerged as new RHEL-based options. RHEL variants, including CentOS and AlmaLinux, ensure compatibility with RHEL software. Ubuntu and Fedora are favored by developers and educational institutions. Major distributors offer long-term support, updates, and certifications to keep systems secure and efficient.
